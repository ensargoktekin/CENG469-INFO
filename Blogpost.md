Blog Post: Developing My Match-3 Game
Introduction
For my term project, I embarked on the journey of developing a match-3 game. This project entailed a comprehensive development process, including the design and implementation of game mechanics, user interface, levels, and additional features. Throughout this blog post, I will discuss the difficulties faced during the project, the solutions employed to overcome them, design choices made, features aimed to implement, and those successfully incorporated. Additionally, I will share intermediate visuals and a detailed project demonstration video.

Initial Goals and Features
The initial objectives for my match-3 game included a set of ambitious features designed to enhance player engagement and experience. These goals were:

Basic Match-3 Gameplay Mechanics: Implementing the fundamental match-3 mechanics where players swap adjacent tiles to form a row or column of three or more matching tiles.
Multiple Levels with Increasing Difficulty: Designing multiple game levels that progressively increase in difficulty to challenge the player.
Score Tracking and High Scores: Creating a scoring system that tracks player scores and records high scores for replayability.
Power-ups and Special Tiles: Introducing various power-ups and special tiles to add excitement and strategic depth to the game.
User Interface with Menu Options: Developing a user-friendly interface with menus for navigating through different game sections.
Sound Effects and Background Music: Adding sound effects for game actions and background music to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Challenges Faced and Solutions
Throughout the development process, several challenges arose. Here’s a detailed account of these difficulties and the solutions implemented:

1. Gameplay Mechanics:

Challenge: Implementing smooth and accurate match-3 gameplay mechanics, including tile swapping, matching, and clearing.
Solution: After researching various algorithms, I adopted a grid-based approach for managing tile positions and matching logic. Extensive debugging was conducted to ensure the animations were smooth and glitch-free. Utilizing an abstract class as a base item, I created a flexible framework for different tile types and behaviors.
2. Level Design:

Challenge: Designing levels with balanced difficulty was challenging, as it required careful planning and iterative testing.
Solution: I developed a custom level editor tool that allowed for quick adjustments and testing of level configurations. This tool significantly streamlined the level design process, enabling the creation of well-balanced and engaging levels.
3. Score Tracking:

Challenge: Implementing a fair and accurate scoring system, particularly with combo matches and power-up effects.
Solution: A detailed scoring algorithm was developed that accounted for chain reactions and special tile effects. Rigorous testing ensured that the score calculations were accurate and fair.
4. User Interface:

Challenge: Designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that was easy to navigate.
Solution: I used design tools to prototype the UI before implementation. Feedback from initial user testing was invaluable in refining the interface to enhance usability and visual appeal.
5. Sound Integration:

Challenge: Adding sound effects and background music without compromising the game’s performance.
Solution: Efficient audio libraries were utilized, and audio files were compressed to maintain performance. The audio elements were carefully integrated to ensure they enhanced the gaming experience without causing lag or other issues.
6. Abstract Class Implementation:

Challenge: Designing a flexible and reusable code structure for game items.
Solution: I used an abstract class as a base item for different game entities. This approach allowed for easy extension and modification of item behaviors, contributing to a more organized and maintainable codebase.
Design Choices
The design choices made throughout the project were guided by the goal of creating an engaging and visually appealing game:

Visual Style: A vibrant and colorful theme was chosen to appeal to a wide audience. Attention was given to detail in tile design and animations to create a visually stimulating experience.
User Experience: Emphasis was placed on creating a smooth and responsive gameplay experience. Clear visual feedback and intuitive controls were key components of the design.
Modularity and Flexibility: The game’s architecture was designed to be flexible, allowing for the easy addition of new levels, power-ups, and features in the future. The use of an abstract class as a base item played a significant role in achieving this flexibility.
Implemented Features
The following features were successfully implemented in the game:

Core Gameplay Mechanics: The fundamental match-3 gameplay was implemented, including tile swapping, matching, and clearing.
Multiple Levels: Several levels with varying difficulty were created, providing a progressively challenging experience for players.
Score Tracking: A comprehensive scoring system was developed, tracking player progress and recording high scores.
Power-ups and Special Tiles: Various power-ups, such as bombs and row clearers, were introduced to add strategic depth to the gameplay.
User Interface: A clean and intuitive UI was developed, featuring menus, score displays, and level selection options.
Sound Effects and Music: Sound effects for tile actions and background music were integrated to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Features Not Implemented and Reasons
Despite the progress made, some features were not implemented due to time constraints and other challenges:

Online Leaderboards:

Reason: Integrating an online database for storing and retrieving scores proved to be complex and time-consuming. Given the project’s timeframe, this feature was deprioritized in favor of core gameplay elements.
Advanced AI Opponents:

Reason: Developing sophisticated AI opponents required significant resources and time. The focus was placed on perfecting the player experience and core mechanics.
